LeaveNoTrace

LeaveNoTrace is an MVC web application that allows users who sign up to keep track of hikes they've posted and browse hikes that other users have posted.  A user chooses a trailname on signup which they use to log in. Users must be logged in to create/update/delete hikes they have posted and to view all hikes posted by other users.
